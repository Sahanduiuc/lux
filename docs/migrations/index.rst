Lux use `Alembic <https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ as tool
to provide migrations. It integrate all alembic commands inside
``manage.py`` and gather configuration from project's config file.

**NOTE:** This documentation assume that you know Alembic and its usage.

+=============================================================================+
| If you will use autogenerated mgrations **ALWAYS** check the outputs, as    |
| the mechanism is not bugfree and may contains errors that needs to be fixed |
| manually.                                                                   |

Requirements
============

In order to be able to use migrations you need to have Alembic installed::

    pip install alembic

When Alembic is already installed, you can now use
``manage.py alembic -h`` to get all possible commands.

Configuration
=============

Lux provide default configuration that will works with some limitation.

Default settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``script_location`` points to core project directory.
2. autogenerate migrations are available.
3. logging is set to default project's logging.

**Warning**
Autogenerated migrations have some limits on what and how can be discovered.
More info can be found in `Alembic Auto Generating Migrations
<https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html>`_.

Custom settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to overwrite default setting, you have to define ``MIGRATIONS``
dict in your config file.

To overwrite main alembic settings create ``alembic`` key: ::

    MIGRATIONS = {
        'alembic': {
            'script_location': './migartions',
            ...
        }
    }

Refer to `Alembic .ini <https://goo.gl/Zeam9i>`_ to get available options.

To change logging behaviour provide: ::

    MIGRATIONS = {
        'alembic': {
            'script_location': './migartions',
            ...
        },
        'metadata': {
            '<db_name>': '<project_name>.<module_name>.models.Base'
        },
        'logging': {
            'path': '<path_to_logging_config_file>'
        }
    }

You have to provide proper config file for logging. Refer to
`Python logging <https://goo.gl/4s669q>`_

Console commands
================

Lux provide a command line ``migration.py alembic`` that provide almost the
same sets of commands as Alembic. The main difference is that there is no
command ``list_templates`` as lux provide only one default template.
Also there is one new command ``auto``.

The ``auto`` command is in fact only abbreviation for: ::

    alembic revision --autogenerate

Anything else is similar to alembic commands.

Usual workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In new project (or in one where you want to start using migrations) use: ::

    python3 manage.py alembic init

This will create a ``migrations`` folder in main dir of your project. You can
change the destination by setting appropriate value in ``MIGRATIONS`` dict.

2. When you already initialized your migration directory it is a time for
creating initial structure of your database. It can be achieve in two ways:

* Using autogenerated migrations by: ::

    python3 manage.py alembic auto -m initial

**NOTE:** You must have empty database schema for this. If not you will
get an empty revision file.

* Manually by: ::

    python3 manage.py alembic revision -m initial

This will create empty revision template file where you will have to
put your migrations commands by yourself.

3. Whenever your models have changed use: ::

    python3 manage.py alembic auto -m <revision_name>

to update your migrations. You can also use ``revision`` command and finish
migration manually.

4. To bring your database to the newest state: ::

    python3 manage.py alembic upgrade heads

instead of ``heads`` you can put revision id to upgrade only to particular
revision.

5. If, for any reasons, you want revert database to previous state use: ::

    python3 manage.py downgrade <revision_id>

Editing env.py
===============

The ``env.py`` file is customized to read from ``MIGRATIONS`` settings.
You may change it to achieve desired logic. You are doing it on own risk!
